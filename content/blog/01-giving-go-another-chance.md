I decided to start tracking the time I spent on tasks a bit better than with a pen and a piece of paper. After a bit of searching I came across this [list](https://www.linuxlinks.com/timetrackers/). I tried all of the tools on it and I stuck with [timetrap](https://www.linuxlinks.com/timetrap/) for a while. But some things bugged me about it.

First of all I'd like to be able to add tags without additional parsing or relying on `grep`. I also would like to be able to backup the database to something centralized or even better use a git repo as a backend. And most of all I wanted to scratch an itch and write a simple tool in a new (sort of) language.

I started to poke around Rust a little while ago and I thought it would be a great fit. But after looking for crates (libraries) that I would need, I decided to give Go another chance. I used it before at work at some point and it kinda worked and was a good fit there. I also remember to have a bitter taste in my mouth after using it back then. So I'm gonna try it again and see how it feels a few years later.

I'm gonna document my steps and track the time I spent on the tasks. Let's start!
